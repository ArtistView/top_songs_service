# ArtistView

ArtistView is a full stack application that provides users a seemless way to browse through an artist's songs and albums. Each page is dedicated to one specific artist. The application has fully functioning audio capabilities.

This repository holds the top songs component. The component ranks the artist's songs based on the most listens and shows top five, with the album image, song duration, and the ability to play the song, add it to a queue, or add it to a playlist.
